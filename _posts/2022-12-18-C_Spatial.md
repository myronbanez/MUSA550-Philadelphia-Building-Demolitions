Visualizing building demolitions by census tracts on a map allows viewers to see if there are any spatial relationships with demolitions to determine if there are particular areas that are more likely to experience demolitions.

From 2007 to 2022, census tract 169.02 has seen the greatest number of building demolitions at 254. The plot shows that a majority of demolitions have occurred in the census tracts just north of Center City.
