Another way to visualize the data is by creating a brush plot that allows for interactivity to see building demolitions over time in the individual census tracts.

The plot shows the extreme increase in demolitions in tract 169.01 in 2011. The plot also visualizes consistent and comparitively more demolitions in tracts 167.01, 168, and 169.02 than the other tracts.
