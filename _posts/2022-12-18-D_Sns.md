# Demolitions by Year

Matplotlib is used to visualize this data to show a clear and simple overview of high level information regarding building demolition. As a result of showing total demolitions by year, a bar plot easily depicts this data to compare the years side by side and identify trends.

Looking at just the top census tracts, census tract 169.01 in 2011 sticks out with the largest amount of building demolitions at 68. Additionally of the top census tracts, 2010 sticks out as a year with many building demolitions simply by the amount and consistency of the darker color of the cells.
