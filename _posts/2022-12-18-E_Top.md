After further analyzing individual census tracts, I now want to see what share of demolitions the top census tracts had by year using a stacked bar plot. This method allows for color coding visualizing the census tracts within each year while comparing across years and an interactive tool to exactly see the exact number of demolitions.

This plot reaffirms that in 2011, census tract 169.01 saw a major increase in building demolitions when compared to the rest of the years. Although tract 169.01 experienced drastically more demolitions in 2011, year 2010 also sticks out as the year with the greatest building demolitions for the top census tracts.
